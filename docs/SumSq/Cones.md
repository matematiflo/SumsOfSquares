We defines precones, etc. and show that sums of squares form a precone.

in a ring: precone, **cone**, support of a precone, support of a precone is an additive subgroup, support of a cone is an ideal, prime cones

**example: sums of squares**

**(compare all of this to positive cone in mathlib, see Leiden pdf again)**

in a field: all cones are prime

in a ring: order on precones, maximal precones are prime cones

in a field: all cones are maximal precones

in a field: **cones in F ↔ orderings on F**

in a ring: prime cones with support P in R ↔ orderings of Frac(R/P)

```lean
structure Cone' (R : Type) [Ring R] :=
  (P : Set R)  -- I guess here it could be a sub-type? Would it just change the way the axioms are written? (no ∈)
  (zero : 0 ∈ P)
  (add : ∀ (x y : R), x ∈ P ∧ y ∈ P → x + y ∈ P)
  -- etc

#check @Cone'

def test [Ring R] (P : Cone' R) : P = P := by rfl

-- WE NEED A CLASS!

class Cone (R : Type) [Ring R] : Type :=
  P : Set R   -- I guess here it could be a sub-type? Would it just change the way the axioms are written? (no ∈)
  zero : 0 ∈ P
  add : ∀ (x y : R), x ∈ P ∧ y ∈ P → x + y ∈ P
  -- etc

#check @Cone

def ConeRefl [Ring R] [P : Cone R] : P = P := by rfl

-- If I want to prove that the sum of squares is a cone, is it better with structure or with class?

**ANOTHER FILE: Formally real**

semireal ring if -1 is not a sum of squares *see Zulip discussion about semirings again*

real ring if sum of squares = 0 implies all terms are 0

for fields, the two are equivalent


the characteristic of a (semi?)real ring is 0

**Artin-Schreier theory**

example of a formally real field: ordered field

-> study the converse

**Real-closed fields**

characterisation

existence and uniqueness of the real closure of an ordered field

**NEXT: ideals (towards real Nullstellensatz)**

real ideals (in rings...)

**NEXT: real spectrum**

definition (as set of prime cones), topology, structure sheaf

example: `Spr R[T]`

map to the Zariski spectrum

```lean
-- Other things we can prove: S is a sum of squares iff it lies in the submonoid generated by the squares... (in particular, the squares are sums of squares...) and this is equivalent to the existence of a list such that S is the sum of the squares of the entries of the list. **GOES INTO FILE ABOUT CONES?**
