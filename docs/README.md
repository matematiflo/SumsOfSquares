## Workflow

1. Create `.md` files in a folder `docs` inside the repo.
2. Convert them to `.html` (for instance using [Quarto](https://quarto.org)).
3. The folder `docs` should contain at least one file `index.html`.
4. Deploy from branch `main` and publishing source `docs` using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) (accessible directly from the repository's Settings at `repo/settings/pages`).
